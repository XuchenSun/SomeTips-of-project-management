# The-philosophy-of-project-management

The final aim of project management is to make the project better. From my experence, project managment has a beneficial effect but focuing on project is more important.

To make the project easier to control, I summarise some necessary steps for finishing project.




***Everyday Work Report***


This is the most important thing, which will let other know what you have done for every day.

Sometimes, the processing percentage may be changed due to some things, but everyday work report is the most valuable thing which can make you feel sense of accomplishment.

Normally, people abandon project because they feel hopless about the process. In other words, they feel they can not finish on time or it is too difficult than expected.

Therefore, everyday work report can help people to build necesaary confidence which is very important.
